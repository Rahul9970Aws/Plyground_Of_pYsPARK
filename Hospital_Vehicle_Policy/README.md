 In your insurance ETL pipeline, once you've ingested the files (CSV, JSON, XML, TXT) and loaded them to your **Bronze layer**, the **next step** involves **data modeling** â€” especially for analytical/reporting use cases. Here's how to think about **dimension vs fact** tables.

---

### âœ… **Which files can be moved to Dimension Tables?**

Files or datasets containing **descriptive, slowly changing, or reference-like information** should go to **dimension tables**.

| File / Table Name       | Description                                                              | Table Type    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `customer_data.csv`     | Info about policyholders (name, DOB, gender, address, etc.)              | Dimension     |
| `policy_data.csv`       | Policy type, coverage, start/end dates, premium info                     | Dimension     |
| `provider_data.csv`     | Info about hospitals, agents, or third-party claim handlers              | Dimension     |
| `vehicle_data.csv`      | If auto insurance: vehicle type, model, year, registration info          | Dimension     |
| `hospital_data.csv`     | For health insurance: hospital name, location, accreditation, etc.       | Dimension     |
| `region_data.csv`       | Regional or geographic mapping (state, zone, city)                       | Dimension     |
| `product_data.csv`      | Details about different insurance products                               | Dimension     |

### ðŸ“Š **Fact Table: Insurance Claims**

The **fact table** captures **measurable business processes or events**, like a claim being submitted or a payment being made.

Hereâ€™s a typical structure for your **Fact_Claim** table:

| Column Name         | Description                                          | Notes                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `claim_id`          | Unique identifier for each claim                    | Primary Key                        |
| `customer_id`       | Foreign Key to Customer Dimension                   | FK to `dim_customer`               |
| `policy_id`         | Foreign Key to Policy Dimension                     | FK to `dim_policy`                 |
| `provider_id`       | Foreign Key to Provider Dimension                   | FK to `dim_provider` (if exists)   |
| `claim_date`        | Date of claim                                       |                                  |
| `claim_type`        | Type of claim (Accident, Health, Theft, etc.)       | Could also be a dimension          |
| `claim_amount`      | Amount claimed                                      | Fact / measurable metric           |
| `approved_amount`   | Final approved payout                               | Fact / measurable metric           |
| `claim_status`      | Status (Approved, Pending, Rejected)                | Could be dimension or string       |
| `region_id`         | Link to region dimension (optional)                 | FK to `dim_region`                 |
| `submission_channel`| Online, Agent, Walk-in                              | Optional Dimension                 |
| `inserted_at`       | ETL load timestamp                                  | Audit field                        |

### ðŸ§  Pro Tips:
- Dimensions are **denormalized**, human-readable, and often used in **GROUP BY**, **filter**, or **drill-down** operations in reporting.
- Fact tables are **normalized**, contain **foreign keys**, and mostly have **metrics** and **timestamps**.
- Consider implementing **SCD Type 2** in dimension tables like Customer or Policy if historical changes need tracking.
